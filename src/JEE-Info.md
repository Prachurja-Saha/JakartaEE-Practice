# (JEE/J2EE) Short History
1. `J2EE`
2. Released by Sun Microsystems in 1999 as part of the Java 2 Platform designed for building large-scale,
   distributed, and component-based applications, mainly focusing on enterprise-level solutions.
3. As part of the Java family, it extended Java SE (Standard Edition) to support web applications, enterprise services, 
   and network-based communication.
4. `JEE (Java EE, now Jakarta EE)`
5. In 2006, with the release of Java 5, J2EE was rebranded as Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition).
6. In 2017, Oracle donated Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation, where it was rebranded as Jakarta EE in 2018 due to 
   licensing issues

# JEE : 
Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) is a set of specifications that extend the Java SE platform for building web applications,
distributed systems, and enterprise-level applications. It provides a standardized and simplified way to 
develop scalable, secure, and reliable applications for businesses.


# (JEE/J2EE) My Target -> JPA, SERVLET, JSP, WebSocket API
Technologies/Services JEE provides ->
`Web Layer`: Technologies like Servlets, JSP, and JSF (JavaServer Faces) for handling web requests.
 [Servlet -  Handles HTTP requests and responses, making them essential for building web applications.]   

`Business Layer`: EJBs, CDI, and JPA manage business logic and database interactions.
 [JPA- Manages relational data in enterprise applications, simplifying the interaction with databases 
  by using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).]

`Integration Layer`: JMS, JAX-RS, and JAX-WS for messaging and web services.
